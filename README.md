This is part of my notes in computer issues, most of them are about 
programming. I am planing to re-assemble and publish some of the other 
notes:

1. Basic Internet development (front end)
2. Java

However, for most of other topics, such as probability and 
statistics, machine learning and vim, I don't have soft copies of my notes.
