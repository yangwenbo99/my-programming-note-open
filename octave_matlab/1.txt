3. Variables
	3.1) MATLAB is a weakly typed language
		no need to initialize variables, and variables can be change to any
		type without redefine./

		Typically, MATLAB has the following types:
			- vectors
			- matrices
				-- both of chars or doubles
		And some other types:
			- complex, symbolic, 16-bits and 8-bits integers
	
	3.2) Built-in variables
		NEVER use them.
		- *i* and *j* indicates complex numbers
		- *pi*
		- ans
		- Inf and -Inf
		- NaN
	
	3.3) Vector
		size(), length()
	3.x)
		save file var var ...
		clear var var
		load file
		% can also save all
		save myenv; clear all; load myenc;


4. travel between directories
	cd, ls.....

For assignment
- logspace
	+ Return a row vector with N elements logarithmically spaced from 10^A to 10^B
- ones & zeros & diag & reshape & nan
- floor & cell
- rand & randi
- sqrt &  log
- real & imag & conj
	+ real: real part
	+ imag: imaginary part
	+ conj: conjunction (共軛)
