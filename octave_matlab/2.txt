1. function
	functions also store in ".m" files, the only differences between functions
	and script is that functions have function declaration.

	% this is help file of the function
	% here, the usage of the function should be stated
	% and provides some extra usful information
	function [this, is, output] = function_name(inputs)

	NOTE: 
		a. Function name must match file name
		b. *function* must be used
		c. Inputs must be specified
		d. If return more than one vars, brackets must be used
		e. MATLAB will return the vars whose name match the definition
		f. Any variables created within the function but not returned disappear after the function stops running
	
2. logical operations
	2.1) 
		"not equal" is ~=, but not !=
	2.2) logical operators
		+-----------+-------------+--------------+
		|           |             | short-circuit|
		| Name      | Elementwise |(only scalars)|
		+----------------------------------------+
		| and       | &           | &&           |
		| or        | |           | ||           |
		| not       | ~           |              |
		| xor       | xor         |              |
		| all true  | all         |              |
		| any true  | any         |              |

3. Flow control
	Since studied, skip this.

4. Plot
	4.1) Line plot
		since studied, only briefly review......
		plot()
			doc line_props
		semilogx(x, y, '');		% same as plot, but the x-axis will be loged 
		similogy(x, y, '');
		loglog(x, y, '');

	4.2) 3D plot
		plot3();
		xlim, ylim, zlim
		
		4.2.1) axis modes
			axis square
				makes the current axis look like a box
			axis tight
				fits axis to data
			axis equal
				x and y scale the same
			axis xy
			axis ij

			also, other information can be sent to axis,
			for example, limits of axies...

		4.2.2) multiple plots
			subplot(2, 3, 1)
				// make the plot window 2(r) * 3(c) and active the first one
			subplot(2, 3, 1:3)
			close([1 3])
			close all;

		4.2.3) colormap
			use *imagesc(mat);* to generate image, and use *colormap* to
			chose color map, 

			"The colormap should be an N row by 3 column matrix. The columns
			contain red, green, and blue intensities respectively. All
			entries must be between 0 and 1 inclusive. The new colormap is
			returned."
		
		4.2.4) surface
			use loop or meshgrid() to generate x and y matrix
			use *surf()* or *mesh()* to plot
			use *shading* to change its look
				- shading facted
				- shading flat
				- shading interp

		4.3.5)
			contour(X, Y, Z, [n]);
	
	4.3) specialized plotting functions
		polar(X, Y)
		bar(X, Y)
		quiver(X, Y, vX, vY); 		% draw a victor field...
		stairs-plot piecewise constant functions
		fill						% polygon

		4.2.5) use *contour*(等高線) to plot 2-variable function in a plane

5. find
	inds = find(x>0.4 & x<0.6);
