- 4 space, rather than tab
- wrap line, 79 characters
- blank line
- comment on the line of their own

- `CamelCase` for classes and `lower_case_with_underscores` for functions 
  and methods. Always use `self` for the first method argument.
- Always use UTF-8 for encoding, and generally, all characters should be in

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
```
