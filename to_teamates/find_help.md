# How to find help

It is important to have a good understanding skill. If you encounter some problem, you first need to understand the error information. 

## Reading and comprehension skill

**Practices:**

Read the following paragraphs, and answer questions.

1. Suppose once you don't know vim, but open it unexpectedly, then you type `<C-c>` to try to exit the vim. However, you got a message at the end of the screen:

		Type   :qa!  and press <Enter> to anbandon all changes and exit vim

	- Question: how to quit vim

2. Suppose you wrote a C program, and try to compile it. GCC gave you some error information:

		./1.c: In function ‘increase’:
		./1.c:26:24: error: ‘y_’ undeclared (first use in this function); did you mean  y_1’?
			d_y_1 = call_fun(x_1, y_);
														^~
														y_1
		./1.c:26:24: note: each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it appears in

	- Question: where and what is the mistake.

## Generally procedure to find help

1. If it is due to an error read error information and try to solve by yourself.  
2. If you want to know library function, language specification or so, use a specified site for help. For example, w3school and MDN for web development and Oracle's Java API specification websites.
3. If you cannot figure out what cause the error, or you don't know where to find the information, Google it (by "Google it", I mean using search engines to search for that information, the search engines can be DuckDuckGo, Google, Baidu or any other search engine).
4. If you still cannot solve you problem using above ways, find some people for help. For example, your teammates, the developers or the software's community. (This is the _last_ step to do when you need help, but _not_ the first step)

**Practices:**
1. Suppose your newly assembled a powerful computer, and got a blue screen when you install Windows 7, and receive error code `0x0000003E`. What is wrong? 
2. Install `BeautifulSoup` on your computer.
